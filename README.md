# Trenz TEI0026-01 Enpirion Power Board (MAX10 Power Sequencer )

![TEI0026](TEI0026.png)

MAX10 Power Sequencer: Control 4 voltage rails via USB/PC and adjust on the fly from 0.8V to 3.3V, with up to 1A per rail. Perfect full automated voltage systems or laboratory, sequenced by MAX10. Includes a full PC controlled power demo, to Jump Start the board.

I got one of them as a free of charge Arrow promotion board in the European "JUMP START" Program for FPGAs.

I requested documentation to both Trenz electronics and Arrow Europe. Both of them replied with the documentation found in this repo.

After requesting documentation for this board, Arrow  published this repository https://github.com/ArrowElectronics/tei0026-01. Names this board as "Trenz TEI0026-01 Enpirion Power Board" and indicates that the Enpirion product line has been discontinued.
